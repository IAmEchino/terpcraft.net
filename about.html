                <p class="bigText"> TerpCraft is a Vanilla+ SMP server for the Java Edition of Minecraft. </p>
                    
                <p class="bigText"> It is the result of a merger between two servers, TerpCraft (2018 - 2022) and EchinoMC. </p>

                <p class="bigText"> TerpCraft was previous under the ownership of jprad, who ran the server from at least 2019 to 2022. The current server administration is attempting to make contact with former administrators to try and obtain more information about the server's time prior to the TerpCraft-EchinoMC merger. Any information we obtain will be posted here ASAP. </p>

                <h2 class="giantText TerpCraft textAligner"> Season 1 </h2>

                <p class="bigText"> The server which would later be known as EchinoMC was founded in June of 2015 by Echino. This initial server world persisted for half a decade, seeing little growth in playerbase and only minor development of civilization.</p>

                <p class="bigText"> This initial phase of the server, known today as <span class="TerpCraft">Season 1</span>, would turn out to be crucial in influencing future developments within EchinoMC. In particular, on March 19th of 2016, EchinoMC made its first attempt to transition to a factions server. This proved to be fruitless, however, as the playerbase was simply too small at the time to support major inter-group conflict. It was through this experience, however, that the server admin began to understand the dynamics that would need to exist in order to have a functional system of international play. </p>
