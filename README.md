# terpcraft.net
The website for TerpCraft, the Minecraft server at the University of Maryland.


## To-Do List
- Navbar needs to be totally reworked, it's probably some of the worst code I've written in my life. You can make it in Javascript if that's more to your liking.
- Sticky mechanism needs to be fixed using a fixed version of this template.
- Try to keep the appearance similar in nature (black background, Minecraft font, color scheme, etc.) but feel free to make any enhancements to scaling, etc.

## Other Objectives
- Update website to include modded server information
- Add QOL Features
  - Modpack Download Links
  - Possibly a way to have multiple dynmaps?
  - Other Ideas?
