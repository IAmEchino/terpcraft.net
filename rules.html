                    TL;DR: Join or make a nation within three days. You need three members. Claim using the in-game map. Make the claim not a literal square; follow your coasts, rivers, and other natural features. Don't claim a crazy amount. Don't name your nation after real places. Declare a government type and tell the Secretary General (SecGen) what it is. Make a unique banner, and give that to the SecGen too.

                            <li>Nations cannot be formed solely in the Nether or End. Nations may have bases or outposts there, but nations must claim in the Overworld.</li>
                            <li>Nations may not claim territory in MapFrontiers that has already claimed by another nation.</li>
                            <li>Lands may not extend over an inordinately large amount of space. The Secretary General of the United Nations will determine if a land has over-extended itself and reduce it in size or delete it entirely if necessary.

                                            <li>How close is the new claim to pre-existing territory of the land in question? The further away a claim is from pre-existing territory, the smaller it should be.</li>
                                            <li>Could the areas being claimed be considered even somewhat superfluous "buffer zones" around their main territory, for the purposes of national security and/or basic expansion? Take these zones into account, as they are permitted.</li>
                                            <li>How large is the population of the land in question? The smaller the population, the less land they should possess.</li>
                                            <li>Does the membership of the land in question have some semblance of an idea of what they want to do with the claim in question, and does that idea reasonably require the amount of land claimed?</li>
                                            <li>Does the nation in question have a historical ownership over the area they are claiming or have claimed previously? For example, if Kingdom A's members built an area in years past and wish to reclaim that area for Kingdom A, they should be permitted to do so. Similarly, if Kingdom A has ruled over a large area for multiple months or years without a dispute, then that area should probably remain theirs.</li>

                    TL;DR: No griefing. Consult the chart below before committing theft. Don't give new players elytras. Raid farms are only allowed for farming emeralds, and must be equipped with totem filtration systems. Don't build amonguses (unless you want to start a World War). Don't use hack clients. Don't use exploits except for TNT, sand/gravel and carpet duping. You can use schematic mods like Litematica if you'd like.

                                Griefing is defined as the destruction, placement, or modification of blocks which creates a significant inconvenience for another person. Please note that repeated incidents of minor inconvenience can together be considered a significant inconvenience and cause a person's behavior to qualify as griefing. Each incident of alleged griefing will be considered on a case-by-case basis by server staff.

                    <li>Stealing and then burning/destroying items is considered griefing.</li>
                    <li>Stealing is legal, but server members have decided that it must be done in compliance with the rules below. The purpose of these rules is to maintain some semblance of order on the server and also to allow items to be returned with relative ease should a settlement be reached between the parties involved.</li>

                    TL;DR: The main body of the United Nations (UN) is the UN General Assembly (UNGA). 
                    Each land with three members becomes a voting member of the UNGA and can vote on proposed resolutions and amendments. 
                    In order for the things the UNGA passes to actually count, UNGA meetings have to be presided over by a UN official, and >=66% of active nations have to be there. 
                    The SecGen has some power to make some basic executive orders, but the UNGA can overrule them. 
                    UNGA meetings can be called by any voting member, and members may be removed for violating decorum. 
                    UN land is neutral ground and may not be attacked.

                    <li>UNGA meetings can be called by any voting member, so long as the reason for doing so is not facetious (as determined by the SecGen).

                        Even artifacts which <i>appear</i> to be hateful must have a clear and believable explanation as to why they are not and the creator must provide a justification as to why it needs to exist on this server.
